## Exploration 1



## Findings : 
Comparing the corruption index with the UN's Human Development Index (a measure combining health, wealth and education), demonstrates an interesting connection. When the 
corruption index is between approximately 20.0 and 40.0 there appears to be little relationship with the human development index, but as it rises beyond 4.0 a stronger connection 
can be seen. Outliers include small but well-run poorer countries such as Afganistan and Congo, while Greece, Italy stand out among the richer countries and Finland, Norway stand
out among the richest countiesties.
