## Data Visualization Project using R

A correlation between Corruption and Development: Corruption Perceptions Index , 2018 (Rating from 1 To 100 where 100 is the least corrupt nation) Human Developement Index, 2018 (Rating from 0.1 To 1.0 where 1 is best).

## Findings : 
Comparing the corruption index with the UN's Human Development Index (a measure combining health, wealth and education), demonstrates an interesting connection. When the corruption index is between approximately 20.0 and 40.0 there appears to be little relationship with the human development index, but as it rises beyond 4.0 a stronger connection can be seen. Outliers include small but well-run poorer countries such as Afganistan and Congo, while Greece, Italy stand out among the richer countries and Finland, Norway stand out among the richest countiesties.
